# lit-solid

# Installation

```bash
npm install lit-solid solid-auth-client
```

# Usage

To be written.

# Browser support

lit-solid uses relatively modern JavaScript features that will work in all commonly-used browsers, except Internet Explorer. If you need support for Internet Explorer, it is recommended to pass it through a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io), and to add polyfills for e.g. `Set`, `Promise` and `Array.prototype.includes`.
